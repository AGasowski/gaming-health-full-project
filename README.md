# ESCAPAD 2022 - Gaming and Health Analysis (Full Project)

This repository contains the final report produced for a statistical analysis
project completed at ENSAI. The study investigates the relationships between
gaming behaviour (video games and gambling) and a range of physical and mental
health indicators among French adolescents, using data from the ESCAPAD 2022
national survey.

This repository represents the full project delivered by the group.  
My personal contribution and individual code are available separately (link
below).


## Project Overview

The goal of the study was to analyse how two types of gaming activities:

- **Video gaming**
- **Gambling**

are associated with:

- general health perception,
- body mass index (BMI),
- medical follow-up,
- depressive risk (ADRS score),
- and lifestyle characteristics.

The analysis relies on descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing (Chi-squared
tests, Cramer's V), and multivariate methods such as Multiple Correspondence
Analysis (MCA).

More details can be found in the full report.
